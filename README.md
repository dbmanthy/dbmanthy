## Coding Playground
*Experimental projects to explore new concepts and skills. Not everything here is polished but they're a lot of fun!*

|In a world with many non-related software companies and data libraries, conversion algorithms are vital for cross-platform communication. In this project, a basic facial recognition program was created capable of discerning between ten different emoji faces. This program was implemented using an approach based off Muller, Magaia, and Herbstâ€™s paper[2] on facial recognition. Through the use of training sets generated from Facebook and Appleâ€™s emoji libraries, facial averages of eigenfaces were created using the method of SVD factorization. A new unknown set of emoji faces were then compared against these averages and thus matched into their intended emoji expression (Smiley face, laughing face, etc.) by a least squares fit. Through multiple trials, our program was found to have a seventy percent success rate in sorting these unknown emojis, from Googleâ€™s library, into their proper categories.| |
